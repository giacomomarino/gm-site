        "description": "The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a major open biomedical research repository for transcriptomics and other omics datasets. It currently contains millions of gene expression samples from tens of thousands of studies collected by many biomedical research laboratories from around the world. While users of the GEO repository can search the metadata describing studies and samples for locating relevant studies, there is currently no method or resource that facilitates global search of GEO at the data level. To address this shortcoming, we developed Rummageo, a webserver application that enables gene expression signature search against all human and mouse RNA-seq studies deposited into GEO. To enable such a search engine, we performed offline automatic identification of conditions from uniformly aligned GEO studies available from ARCHS4, and then computed differential expression signatures to extract gene sets from these signatures. In total, Rummageo currently contains 135,264 human and 158,062 mouse gene sets from 23,395 GEO studies. Overall, Rummagene provides an unprecedented resource for the biomedical research community enabling hypotheses generation for many future studies.",

By comparing the inputted samples with processed RNA-seq and proteomics data from several atlases, TargetRanger identifies genes that are highly expressed in the target cells while lowly expressed across normal human cell types, tissues, and cell lines.",

Based on gene-gene co-expression correlations created from ARCHS4's processed RNA-seq samples, we present 18,705 human and 11,274 mouse landing pages for long non-coding RNAs that include expression statistics across tissues and cell lines, predicted biological functions, pathway membership, subcellular localization, and predicted small molecules and CRISPR KO genes that may regulate their expression.",

        "description": "The hippocampus is a brain region that plays a key role in memory formation and recall. The hippocampus replays memories, which is thought to be important for memory consolidation. However, the mechanisms underlying hippocampal replay are not well understood. In this project, we use reinforcement learning to simulate hippocampal replay. We train an agent to navigate a maze and then replay the agent's trajectory.",
